# Uncertainty-Visualisation-for-Stock-Prediction
This repository contains the code for LSTM model for predicting stock prices of the company "Google". 
As mentioned in the project report, 3 models (Multilayer Perceptron, LSTM, CNN) were developed for stock prices prediction and, furthermore, 
uncertainty values were calculated for the predicted prices. 
The models have been tested on "Google", "Amazon" and "Facebook" stock price databases. 
In the report, training and testin of all models on "Amazon" database has been discussed along with the results and uncertainty calculation.
Uncertainty Visualisation Graphs are attached in the report. 
The designs for the models are explained in the report as well.
The application of the project lies in the uncertainty visualisation which can be useful for investors to make decisions for 
stock purchanse and stock selling.
