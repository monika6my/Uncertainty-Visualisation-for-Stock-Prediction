# Uncertainty-Visualisation-in-Stock-Prediction
This repository contains the code for an LSTM model built by me for predicting stock prices of the company "Google", and the report describes the 3 models (Multilayer Perceptron, LSTM, CNN) which were devleoped for solving the same problem.

For experimentation, the models were separately trained and tested to predict the stock prices of comapnies - Google, Amazon and Facebook.

The application of the project lies in uncertainty visualisation which can be useful for investors to make decisions for 
stock purchanse and stock selling.

The uncertainty calculation is discussed in the report, and it also contains the visualisation graphs.
