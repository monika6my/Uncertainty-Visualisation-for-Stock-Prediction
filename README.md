# Uncertainty-Visualisation-for-Stock-Prediction
This repository contains the code for LSTM model for predicting stock prices of the company "Google". 
As mentioned in the project report, 3 models (Multilayer Perceptron, LSTM, CNN) were developed for stock prices prediction and, furthermore, 
uncertainty values were calculated for every the predicted prices. 
Uncertainty Graphs are attached in the report. 
The designs for the models are explained in the report as well.
The application of the project lies in the uncertainty visualisation which can be useful for investors to make decisions for 
stock purchanse and stock selling.
